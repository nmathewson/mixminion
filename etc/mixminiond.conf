#   This is a configuration file for the mixminion anonymous remailer.  Edit
#   this file, install it in /etc/ (or elsewhere, if you specify a
#   command-line argument for mixminion), and you're ready to go.
#
#   This file format will probably change between now and version 1.0. Watch
#   out.

[Host]

#   Uncomment this line to define a 'secure delete' command to overwrite
#   deleted files.  (This isn't as secure as you think: see the comment in
#   Common.py).
#
#   If you do not specify a value for this option, and we can't find
#   /usr/bin/shred, we fall back on an internal implementation.
#
#   This is the default command: we just zero out files and unlink them.
#   This choice protects against root (on a non-journaling filesystem), but
#   not against an attacker with deep hardware wizardry and resources.
#
#ShredCommand: /usr/bin/shred -uz -n0

#   Uncomment this line if your system uses a different entropy generator.
#   This file must be a character device that produces a truly random
#   bytestream.
#
#EntropySource: /dev/urandom

#   Ordinarily, Mixminion tries very hard to make sure all your file
#   permissions are reasonable.  Sometimes it is too paranoid for its
#   own good.  When this happens, you can either mark certain users
#   ('system', 'dev', and so on) as trusted, or disable file paranoia entirely.
#
#FileParanoia: yes
#TrustedUser: root

[Server]

#    Location of all mixminion keys and file queues.  You don't need to
#    create this directory; mixminion will do it for you.
#
#    Note that mixminion is fairly strict about its directory permissions:
#    its BaseDir below must be mode 700 and owned by whatever uid mixminion
#    runs as, and all directories above the BaseDir must be writeable by
#    nobody except mixminion and root.
#
#    Don't worry though: Mixminion should give you helpful error messages if
#    you get this wrong.
#
#    (This option used to be called 'Homedir'; either spelling will work.)
#
#BaseDir: /var/spool/mixminion
#BaseDir: /home/miniond/mixminion

#    By defailt, all mixminion-related files are stored in subdirectories
#    of 'BaseDir'.  You can override default placement with the options below.
#    All relative paths are resoled with respect to 'BaseDir'.
#
#    Here are the defaults:
#
#KeyDir: ./keys
#WorkDir ./work
#QueueDir: ./work/queues
#PidFile: ./pid
#LogFile: ./log
#StatsFile: ./stats
#
#    Here is an alternative layout:
#
#BaseDir:   /var/lib/mixminion
#KeyDir:    /var/lib/mixminion/keys
#WorkDir:   /var/lib/mixminion/work
#QueueDir:  /var/spool/mixminion
#PidFile:   /var/run/mixminion/mixminion.pid
#LogFile:   /var/log/mixminion/log
#StatsFile: /var/log/mixminion/stats

#    Minimum severity of messages to include in log file.  Allowable values
#    are: 'NEVER', 'FATAL', 'ERROR', 'WARN', 'INFO', 'DEBUG', and 'TRACE'.
#
#    Warning! If you use 'DEBUG' or 'TRACE', the log may contain message
#    that could compromise anonymity.  Because mixminion is in alpha stage
#    right now, however, you may well want to log at one of these levels.
#
#LogLevel: DEBUG

#   Change this to 'yes' to make the server echo log messages to stdout.
#
#EchoMessages: no

#   Do we keep track of numbers of packets received and so on?  This is
#   on by default.
#
#LogStats: yes

#   Over how long a time period do we aggregate statistics?  Every time this
#   interval elapses, all current statistics are flushed to a file.
#
#StatsInterval: 1 day

#   How many bits should the server use for its long-lived 'Identity' keys?
#   Must be between 2048 and 4096.
#
#IdentityKeyBits: 2048

#   How often should the server rotate its public keys?  If you rotate often,
#   you need less storage space for message hash logs, and messages sent
#   using your old keys are less vulnerable to compomise... but if you rotate
#   too often, your server may drop messages that use out-of-date keys.
#
#   You can't rotate keys more than once a day.
#
PublicKeyLifetime: 3 weeks

#   How long after a key rotation should the old key still work?
#
#   (This should be fairly long, since messages can be delayed in the
#   network when servers go down.  If it's *too* long, however, you
#   enable delaying attacks.)
#
#PublicKeyOverlap: 24 hours

#   Use this option to define a 'nickname' for this server that users will
#   use as a 'friendlier' version of your identity key.
#
Nickname: <Insert nickname here>

#   Use this option to define an administrative contact for the remailer.
#
#Contact-Email: relayadmin@your.domain.here

#   Use this field for information that users of your remailer may want to
#   have.  Must be no longer than 1024 characters.
#
#   NOTE: Users will not necessarily see this field before they use your
#     remailer.
#
Comments: This server has been running Mixminion since version 0.0.6.
   Of course, since Mixminion is still in alpha (or since we haven't
   edited our configuration file since Mixminion came out of alpha), you
   shouldn't trust us with your anonymity yet.

#   Use ONE of these sets of options to configure the pooling algorithm.
#
#   For now, I recommend option one below, even though it's the least secure.
#   It will help us test the system, and distinguish node failure from
#   low volume.  By version 1.0, we'll change the default.
#
#   (1. A Timed mix sends out all messages in the pool every interval.
#       RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING.)
#
MixAlgorithm: Timed
MixInterval: 10 minutes
#
#   (2. A DynamicPool mix always keeps at least 'MixPoolSize' messages in the
#     pool, and never sends out more than 'MixPoolRate' of the messages.)
#
#MixAlgorithm: DynamicPool
#MixInterval: 30 minutes
#MixPoolRate: 50%
#MixPoolMinSize: 5
#
#   (3. A BinomialDynamicPool mix is a randomized version of DynamicPool.
#       When a DynamicPool mix would send P of N messages, a
#       BinomalDynamicPool mix sends each message with probability P/N.)
#
#MixAlgorithm: BinomialDynamicPool
#MixInterval: 30 minutes
#MixPoolRate: 50%
#MixPoolMinSize: 5
