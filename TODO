NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN:

For 0.0.8:
        o Better error messages on expired / not-yet-ready certificates,
          no matter how hard OpenSSL makes it.
        o Dummies and pinging
                o Refactor ClientDirectory to be more modular
                o Retrying needs to be per-destination, not per-packet.
                        o Implement per-destination queue
                        o Tests for per-destination queue
                        o Make MMTP delivery use per-destination queue.
                        o Test upgrade path.
                o Implement pinging

                                o Two-hop pings
                        o Log pings, failed connects, successful connects
                        o Grovel over ping logs as needed
                        o Generate statistics from logs; remember stats
                          across invocations.
                        o Tests for pinging
                o Save stats to disk
                o Make more ping parameters configurable.
                o Fix how uptime is computed: handle edges of days correctly
                o Performance/data examination: is disk use too insanely high?
                - Too many constants in Pinger.py; fix them.
                - Document.  Describe how to replace sqlite with pg or mysql.
        . Distributed directories
               o Spec changes
                       D Statistics go in format?
                       o Specify intermediate/final formats
                       o Intermediate format is server list with signed vote
                       o Final is multi-signed server-list-with-votes.
                       o List of other good directories (clique is who?)
                       o URL layout.
               - Configuration: where are the directory servers?
               . Server
                       o Implement formats: gen and parse
                       o Implement generate-dir-with-votes
                       o Implement read-multi-dirs-with-votes
                       - Implement download-multiple-directories
                       o Implement compute-vote-and-sign
                       - Implement download-multiple-signed-dirs
                       - Implement add-one-more-sig
                       - Document how to run a directory
                . Client
                       - Choose random URL
                       o Validate multiple signatures
                       - Which sigs are valid?  Enough?
                       - Document how to change directory config
                . Test everything
                       . Test generating and parsing vote directory
                       . Test computing result of vote
                       . Test generating consensus directory
                       . Test parsing consensus directory
                       - Test actual directory code.
        . Bugs
                o Make tests pass with bizarre umasks.  (Try 0077, 0000,
                  etc.)
                o Specify acceptable versions in config file for directory,
                  not in ServerList.py
                o Make build process mention where to download openssl if
                  neither wget nor curl is found.
                o Pinger crashes when servers leave the directory, or aren't
                  live in the directory.
                - Let server admins configure return addresses with default
                  real-names, even if users can override.
                - Make client run and unittests not die when there is no
                  thread module.
                o Have -P *5 -t mbox:foo@server always always mean
                  -P *5,server -t mbox:foo
                - Make generate-surb --status-fd output decoding-handle,
                  if that can be made secure.
                o checkPathLength is great; somebody should invoke it. :/
                - time.gmtime is *not* a precise inverse of calendar.timegm,
                  since the latter doesn't know about leapseconds.  Fix this;
                  it can confuse the unit tests and maybe worse.  We can
                  catch it by looking at time.gmtime(78969600) and seeing
                  whether we get (1972,7,3,0,0,0) or one second before.
                o Regenerate SSL certificates more frequently.
                o Drop support for pre-0.0.6 servers; Don't generate IPV4Info
                  any more.
                - Use DB_RECOVER and DB_RECOVER_FATAL as appropriate
                o Tolerate missing /dev/null
                o Don't crash when calling mixminion clean-queue
        - Documentation
                - Make README and Makefile be clearer about how to proceed
                  when no openssl is found, and about option for local
                  install.
                - Make README note that on some NetBSD systems, it's
                  necessary to add -I/usr/pkg/include.  (Also tweak setup.py
                  to make CFLAGS more editable.)

Reach goals for 0.0.8:
        - Specification
                - Clear up specification for payload versions.
                - Clear up specification for NEWS
        - Make 'SIGHUP' reload, (and 'SIGUSR' dump).
                - SIGHUP should reconfigure everything:
                        - Logs
                        - EventStats
                        - securedelete
                        - EntropySource (discard old entropy)
                        - Configuration (as used by key)
                        - File locations (????)
                        - Network setup
                        - Module setup
                        - (What else?)
                - SIGHUP should check whether serverinfo should be
                  regenerated.
                - Add SIGUSR1 to do rotate-and-dump only.
        . Integrator help
                - RFC822 interface to help integrators.
                - "-o" option for queue
                - "-i" option for flush.
                - Maildir-style exit module to help integrators.
                        - Implement MH/Maildir modes
                        - Text/binary modes
                        - With/without decoding handle
                        - Attach to any type.
                - For petmail:
                        - Working,well-designed --status-fd option
                - For mnet:
                        - Implement trivial client side of client API
                        - Specify pluggable modules better.
                        - Consider server APIs
                . Use a 'sendmail'-like program instead of a SMTP server,
                  optionally.
                        o Implement
                        - Test

Require for "0.1.0" (the in-theory-as-good-as-type-II release):
  [Release criteria: Workable replacement for type II.  At least as
  anonymous, usable, secure, and portable.  Other than lack of nymservers,
  also ready to replace type I.  Interfaces are stable enough that
  integrators can start building GUIs and nymservers without expecting large
  incompatible changes.  Target: first half of 2004.  (No guarantees!)]
        - Security
                - Upgrade packet format as necessary.
        - Modules and module support
                - Use STARTTLS as available, if it's not too hard.
                - Real SMTP module
                        - Support multiple exit addresses. (cc, bcc, etc.)
                          Needs to be bandwidth-limited.
                - Support NEWS
        - End-to-end issues
                - Minimal MIME support: allow headers; don't attempt to
                  enforce a single-best format.
        - Configurability
                - Better, documented support for http proxies for
                  downloading directories.
                - Make DH parameter length configurable at 1024 bits
                  (or higher)?
                . Freak out properly on missing/unpublishable IP.
                . Full validation function for client
                . Full validation function for server
                - Support for non-clique topologies (cliques with a few
                  missing links would be sufficient.)
                - Configurable number of threads to scale to multiple CPUs
        - Client support
                - Automatically remove old messages from client queue. (Add
                  'warn after' and 'delete after' configuration options'.)
                - Avoid timing distinguishability attack related to
                  check-dir, gen-path, read-from-stdin: only download
                  directory *AFTER* reading?  Strongly recommend a cron job?
                  Write the whole thing off as not-really-an-attack?
        - Build and install process
                - A well-tested 'make uninstall'
                - RPMS, debs, and so on
                . Make sure we run on solaris and *BSD.
                . Make the software run under cygwin
                        - Installing to relative path
                . An init.d script.
        - Support for multiple directories, with automated agreement.
                - Configurable dirserver fingerprints and URLs.
        - Full documentation
                - Complete docs for all code, with comments and examples.
                - Write guide for module developers
                - Write complete user's manual
                - Complete all other docs
                - History.
        - Dummy messages (as in batching-taxonomy)
        - DoS resistance strategy
                - Timeout connections more aggressively under heavy load
                - What else?
        - Disable heinously insecure operating modes.
        - Log which file has configuration; option to dump config

Other features for "1.0" (no research required):
        - Full statistics
                - Full statistics (ask Len what the list is.)
        - Security
                - Add ability to mark nodes as having same
                  administrative domain.
                - Change pathgen to avoid two nodes with same domain
                  in a row.
                - Change pathgen to avoid using same node for entry
                  and exit?
                - Add jurisdictions to pathgen?
        - Key management
                - Document "server-DELKEYS"
                - Password-protected private identity keys
                - Password-protected private link/packet keys
                - Password-protected dirserver keys
                - There's no need to ever store MMTP keys to disk; we should
                  also rotate them more often.  (Only if identity key is
                  unencrytped.)
        - Better CLIs
                - Add a --status-fd option similar to GPG's so that
                  we can be more easily embedded.
                - Support for sending multiple copies of a packet?
        - ClientAPI correctness
                - Port ClientAPI from C API document.
                - Move other functionality into ClientUtil module.
                - ClientMain should only have CLI functionality.
        - Heavy-duty performance/DoS testing
        - Modules and module support
                - MBOX
                        - Full config validation
                        - Full boilerplate text
                - Tell ModuleManager about async code (as soon as needed)
        - Configurability
                - Make all filenames in server config relative to
                  server home, if not absolute.
                - Support for one-side-only MMTP configurations.
                - Make client-side pooling configurable and more
                  sophisticated.
                - Separate error/other log files.
                - Move boilerplate into outside files.  Add some generic
                  'Boilerplate' functionality.
                - Make SURB logging configurable.
                - Add 'ALLOW' lines to blacklist.
        - Client support
                - Some way to read a reply block *and* a message from

        - Server UI functionality to inspect and clean out pools
        - Port to Twisted, if reasonable (see HACKING)
        - Send/receive large messages without having to suck them all
          into RAM at once.
                - Fragment and unfragment large messages on disk.
        - MMTP / async
                - Retrying should be per-destination, not per-packet.
                  Otherwise, we can leak which packets were first attempted
                  when.
                - Limit number of packets sent over single client
                  connection.
                - Tests for all cases:
                        - Packet to server with bogus IP
                        - Junk
                        - Retry on bogus close.
                        - Multiple senders
                        - Bad senders
                        - Bad recipients
                        - Hunt down leaks
        - Testing
                - Test on other (non-redhat, non-linux) systems
                - COME UP WITH A REAL TESTING STRATEGY FOR PERFORMANCE AND
                  CLI'S AND MULTI-SERVER SITUATIONS.
                - Integration tests
                        - Automated tests for several servers running
                          on one machine.
                        - Tests for servers on several different
                          machines.
                - Repeatable CLI tests.
                        - For client
                        - For server

Features for "1.0" (some research/specification required):
        - Nymservers
        - Modules and module support
                - Incoming email gateway
                        - Insert encoded packet into net.
                        - Reply to a reply block
        - Configurability
                - Make listening configurable for multiple ports/ips, not
                  all of which need be published.  Perhaps allow different
                  rules for each listener. ???? Maybe not really a good idea.
        - Client support: Improved path selection
                - Watch out for servers that are really the
                  same server
                - Only pick from the directory when picking
                  random servers.
                - Notice Allow/Deny.
                - Allow 'oneof' elements in paths.
        - UI issues
                - Notice when out of disk space, die more cleanly.
                  (support max-disk-usage).
        - Dynamic IP support
                - Servers redirect to latest IP if old IP is down.  (Dynamic
                  IP support, after a fashion.)
        - Client support: other
                - Send message to user with known public key
                - Real PKI for end-to-end encryption
        - Directories
                - Support for full-blown multiple-server agreement mechanism
        - IPv6 support (must solve non-clique problem)
        - Generate link padding (if it helps)
        - Notice active attacks and block IPs dynamically.
        - Abuse prevention of some undetermined kind.

WHEN WE GET THE CHANCE:
        [This stuff could be for any version 1.0 or later; it's not a
         requirement for 1.0.]
        - License-friendliness:
                - Switch from OpenSSL to NSS or GNUTLS
        - GUI
        - Security
                - Memlockall wrapper
                - Support for loopback fs automation and shredding.
        - Make DB module choice configurable?
        - Consider dropping support for older Python versions?
